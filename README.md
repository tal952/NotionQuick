# Apk
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tal952/NotionQuick/master/apks/NotionQuick.v1.2.apk

# How it works
Notion has a web clipboard capabilities.
Unlike the app (that takes about 4 seconds to open), the web clipboard activity opens immediately.
The app just shares the blank page: https://tal952.github.io/NotionQuick/ with the Notion app, and give you to set the title.

# Troubleshoot
If you got the message: "app not installed", try to disable Play Protect, Install the app and then enable it again:
